                        <h1>The Steam Engine</h1>
                        <p>The steam engine was created under the industrial revelution.</p>
                        <p>It works by  heating water in a closed (non-flammable)container vaporizing the water into steam and thus creating pressure.</p>
                        <p>The steam moves throug a metal pipe that goes to a cylinder with a sliding "piston" the channels the steam into one side at a time</p>
                        <p>of the piston that spins the wheel(or other mechanisms). This makes the piston move back and forth thus making the wheel spin.</p>
                        <p>  </p>
                        <p>The wheel is connected to a dyno when if its used for power generation. In steam powered trains it is connected to the axel.</p>
